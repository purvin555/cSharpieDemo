Domain Model Notes
1. Assumed that a tax or a price will have to be rounded of to 0.05 only if there are more than 2 decimal places for such a number. 
2. Tax calculation is decoupled from Product price and quantity using a TaxCategory mapping. This is to simulate real world situations where taxation on products vary from time to time.
3. Product and it's packaging are decoupled to accomodate real world situations. 
 - Example: A item is priced in grams but sold in a pack of minimum 2 kgs. 
 - Another Example: Product is priced on per unit but sold in sealed packets of x units. 
4. The taxation, packaging and product are loosely coupled entitities in this design with an aim to allow mix and match options for creating and maintaining a product listings of a target system.

Miscellaneous / Testing 
- Run InsightInvoice.Output project to view expected outputs in a console app. 
--- A verbose option has been provided to show additional information like gross price and taxation per product added to invoice.
- XML comments not applied to classes and methods for compactness. Most of things are self-explanatory. 
- The goal of test coverage is primarily to test calculations of taxes, net price and gross prices with  real world packaging possibilities. 
- Not all classes and properties have unit tests to help primary focus on calculation of prices and taxes for this excercise. 
- The three sample inovice inputs are divided into multiple sub unit tests. 
--- Each product applied in sample invoice has it's taxation and net price unit tested to increase test coverage. 
- Output display formatting is not unit tested assuming it's limited role of descriptive log.
